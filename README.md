Project Name: Blazor Weather App Full-Stack Challenge

Description:

Welcome to the Blazor Weather App Full-Stack Challenge – a comprehensive project designed to assess and enhance your full-stack development skills using Blazor and .NET 8. This repository hosts a default Blazor template that has been tailored to incorporate a practical and interactive weather display feature.

Key Highlights of the Project:

Blazor Front-End: Experience the power of Blazor in creating responsive and dynamic web UIs. The project showcases a weather information display, serving as a perfect starting point to test your front-end development skills.
.NET 8 Back-End: Dive into the back-end built with the latest .NET 8 framework. You will interact with API development, data handling, and possibly extending the backend logic to accommodate new features.
Full-Stack Integration: This challenge is not just about individual front-end or back-end tasks. It’s about creating a harmonious full-stack solution that effectively integrates the Blazor front-end with the .NET 8 back-end.
What You Will Do:

Explore and Enhance: Navigate through the existing codebase, understand its structure, and think of potential improvements or additional features.
Live Coding Interview: Prepare for a live coding session where you will modify, extend, and optimize both front-end and back-end components of the application.
Showcase Your Skills: This is your platform to demonstrate your proficiency in full-stack development, problem-solving abilities, and creativity in implementing practical web solutions.
